# darringer-www
This project contains all HTML content for darringer.com, a static website.   

## How do I contribute content?
1. Create a new github account if you don't have one already (tdarringer for example) - you will need this to contribute new content and changes to this project (and ultimately the website) 
2. Send me your new github id and I will add you as a collaborator to the project 
3. If you don't already have a git client on your machine, download one ([options can be found here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)).  GitHub desktop seems pretty decent for the mac.
4. Use your git client to clone this project locally to your machine.  
5. Try creating a test file, and make sure to test it locally in your browser
6. Use the git client to add, commit, and push this change to the github repository.  You may need to setup a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) as a part of this process.
7. Once any changes are pushed back to githuh, they will be automatically propogaded to [darringer.com](http://www.darringer.com)
